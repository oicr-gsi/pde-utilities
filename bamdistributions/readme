Naive implementation of comparisons: 

"I can use BamDiff to diff two BAM files aligned from the same FASTQ and produce an output text file. Since the number of differences between two files has a direct correlation to the number of lines in the output of a diff, I can use the size of the file output by the diff command as a measure of deviation between the two files. Therefore, if I have a large number of diffed output files, I can collect data on the sizes of those files, with a mean and standard deviation. "

>> This implementation is found in the file sample_cpcg.sh

Better implementation of comparisons:

1. use BWA
2. keep a reference BAM (say the first one) and then keep the diffs of every BAM subsequently. You could use the diff to re-create each BAM in memory and use that to compare to the incoming BAM files. That way we could immediately delete the large files and just keep the smallish diffs.  

>> An attempted implementation of this is found in sample_pop6.sh
>> It still uses novoalign instead of BWA
>> It does not work right now because BamDiff does not play nice with the unix utility Patch. 
>> Next steps: Helpdesk successfully installed BsDiff and BsPatch onto the cluster. They should work with the bam files directly.
